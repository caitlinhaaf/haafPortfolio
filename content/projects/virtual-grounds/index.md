###The Clients
**[Digital Justice Labs](https://digitaljusticelab.ca/)** is a Troronto non-profit organization that examines the impact of technology on various communities with the aim of building a just and equitable digital future for everyone.

**[Trinity Square Video](https://www.trinitysquarevideo.com/)** is a Toronto arts organizaiton that provides artists with training and access to equipment to explore new media arts practices, including video and virtual/augmented reality.

Both clients are collaborating on Virtual Grounds, an ongoing workshop series examining feminist perspectives on digital sustainability and survival. Participants receive training, mentorship, and a production allowance so that they can ultimately research and create their own multimedia art pieces.

###Description

The clients came to me with a well realized design by [Marcia Diaz](https://marciadiaz.myportfolio.com/)
- For each workshop, create a page with a workshop information and links to resources linked to from the "workshops" page
- Have all workshop resources listed under a common "course content" page, sorted by resource type and workshop

###Solution
Since they had a very clear design in mind, I decided it was best to build the front-end from scratch, instead of trying to wrestle with an existing CMS template.

Used JAMstack with a combination of [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) on the front end and deployed using Netlify and the [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

- Netlify CMS allowing clients to easily make edits
- Resources from all workshops are aggregated on the course content pages
- content schema
