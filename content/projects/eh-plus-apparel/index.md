### The Client
**Whealy Motorcycle Repair**, a local Toronto repair shop specializing in repair and restoration of vintage scooters and motorcycles opening in spring 2020.

### Description
The first version of the site would be a simple brochure site with a brief overview of their services, contact information, new location and hours.
Eventually, the goal is to integrate a blog where they could post about any news or upcoming events, and a projects page where they can showcase long term projects and rebuilds.  
The client already had a great logo designed by Andrew McCracken of [Doublenaut](https://www.doublenaut.com/), inspired by classic automotive and oil branding. They wanted to stick with a very clean, modern look that would compliment this aesthetic.

### Solution
I'm a big fan of [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), especially in cases like this where the project requirements are so simple; I was able to build a custom front end with [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) that matched the spirit of the logo.

Once the client is ready to start adding different posts and page types,  [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) would allow the client 

Since the client wanted the ability to add various page types and content


- Used JAM stack, with a combination of Gatsby JS and the Netlify, to build a custom front end to match the design
- Netlify CMS allowing clients to easily make edits
