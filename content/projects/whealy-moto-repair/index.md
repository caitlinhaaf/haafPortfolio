### The Client
Whealy Motorcycle Repair

### Description
The client is a small local motorcycle repair shop. The client already had a great logo designed by Andrew McCracken of [Doublenaut](https://www.doublenaut.com/) and they wanted their site to match this aesthetic.

### Requirements
- First version would be a simple, single page site with all information a prospective client might need, with a quick overview of the available services and contact information.
- Would like to add blog type pages to highlight restoration projects in future

### Solution
- Used JAM stack, with a combination of Gatsby JS and the Netlify, to build a custom front end to match the design
- Netlify CMS allowing clients to easily make edits

### Takeaways
