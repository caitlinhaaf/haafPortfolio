### The Client
Trinity Square Video

### Description
Bodies Borders Fields is an event series, beginning with a three day free symposium, meant to examine blackness and representations of the black experience in art.
>Bodies Borders Fields supports ongoing and future discussions of blackness as an ever-shifting, circulating and transforming factor for the survival and destabilization of colonial systems and institutions.

### The Requirements 
- Provided with program design, tried to match look and feel
- Editable about, contributors, schedule, resources
- Able to add events moving forward

### The Solution
- Introduced Netlify CMS to client with a previous project, so they were familiar with it
- Used JAM stack, with a combination of Gatsby JS and the Netlify, to build a custom front end to match the design
- Netlify CMS allowing clients to easily make edits
- Most current event schedule is displayed

### Takeaways/Future Updates
- Client may have needed a solution more robust than the Netlify CMS
- Add page with archive of schedules from past events
